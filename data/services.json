From 2021-22, it is a 50 per cent rebate on your rates capped at $750 (a permanent increase of $50).\r\n\r\nThis is in addition to an increase to the Utilities Concession by $50 to $750 and an additional one-off $50 increase to the Utilities Concession for 2021-22. Canberrans eligible for the Pensioner General Rates Rebate may also be eligible for the Utilities Concession, if so this brings the total amount of additional cost of living assistance to $150 for 2021-22. This will fully offset the impact of removing the $150 residential rates rebate provided to all households in 2020-21. For more information on the Utilities Concession, visit www.revenue.act.gov.au/community-assistance/utilities-concession.\r\n\r\nEligible applicants will also receive a rebate of $98 for the Fire and Emergency Services Levy.\r\n\r\nIf there are two property owners and they are both eligible for the pension, the household will receive the full rebate. If there is only one person eligible for the pension, 50 per cent of the rebate will be applied.\r\n\r\nIf you have been continuously eligible for the rebate since 30 June 1997, you are covered by a different rebate scheme. The amount of your rebate is 50 per cent of your rates, but your rebate is capped at the 2015–16 level if it exceeds $750.\r\n\r\nA rebate can only be applied from the year of application and not before. If you become a pensioner during the year, contact us as soon as possible to determine whether you’re eligible for a rebate.",

    "description": "Most landlords or agents will ask you to pay a bond when renting a residential property. A bond acts as a security for the performance of the tenant’s obligations under a residential tenancy agreement. Lessors and agents are not required by law to take a bond from a tenant, however, if they do receive a bond, they are required to lodge it with the ACT Revenue Office. Bonds can be any amount up to a maximum of four weeks rent. Lessors and agents must give the tenant a receipt as proof of payment of the bond. Occupancy agreements may require a security deposit be paid.  When a refund is requested, a claim may be made by the lessor (also known as the landlord) for damage caused by a tenant (besides normal wear and tear) or outstanding rent owed.\r\n\r\nThe ACT Revenue Office is responsible for the receipt and management of residential tenancy rental bonds in the ACT under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (the Act) and the Residential Tenancies Regulation 1998 (the Regulation).\r\n\r\nThe ACT Revenue Office does not provide legal advice to tenants, landlords or real estate agents. The Renting Book is a guide to rental laws in the ACT, other useful resources are listed on the Related Resources page of this site.\r\n\r\nIf you are the lessor, you will need to pay land tax for both a rented or vacant property that is not your principal place of residence. You may be liable for the foreign ownership surcharge if you are not an Australian citizen or resident.",
